# diabets_prediction_kaggle
This is a robust machine learning endeavor born out of participation in a Kaggle competition centered around predicting diabetes. 
Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of codeto build and train predictive models aimed at forecasting or diagnosing diabetes based on various type of imput features. Leveraging popular machine learning libraries, the project demonstrates a deep understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

This project's structure may encompass exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, data cleaning techniques to handle missing values or outliers, and the implementation of diverse machine learning algorithms.. Additionally, it might include ensemble methods, cross-validation strategies, and techniques to address class imbalance issues, if present in the dataset.
